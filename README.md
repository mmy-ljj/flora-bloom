# FLORA — In full bloom

指尖花开 · a hand-gesture flower bloom experience.

Pure static site (HTML + CSS + ES modules). No build step, no server, no third-party CDN.

## Why this fork exists

The original page was published behind Cloudflare and loaded fonts from
`fonts.googleapis.com`, which is not reachable from mainland China without a VPN.
This copy:

- self-hosts **all** fonts in `assets/fonts/` (`fonts.local.css`) instead of Google Fonts;
- self-hosts MediaPipe HandLandmarker (`assets/mediapipe/`, task + WASM), no CDN fetch;
- drops the Cloudflare bot-challenge script;
- keeps every path relative, so it works from any static host.

Open the site and it works with no network calls outside this repository.

## Layout

```
index.html            page shell
styles.css            styles
garden.js             bloom logic + hand tracking (ES module)
gesture-core.js       hand math helpers
fonts.local.css       @font-face for the self-hosted fonts
assets/fonts/         woff2 subsets (Cormorant Garamond, DM Sans, Noto Serif SC)
assets/frames/        flower bloom frames (webp 00..28)
assets/seedance/      4 extra species frame sets
assets/mediapipe/     hand_landmarker.task + tasks-vision runtime + wasm
```

## Run locally

```
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/ (the camera/microphone features need https or localhost).

## Deploy

Any static host works. With GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch →
`main` / root.
